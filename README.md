# Anomaly Detection in Transactions

Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour.

## Project Overview

Anomaly detection is a critical aspect of data analysis that involves identifying patterns or instances that deviate significantly from the expected behaviour within a dataset. The challenge is to develop robust anomaly detection models that can accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal data points, thereby assisting in fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and outlier identification. Here the goal is to build a robust model that can accurately distinguish legitimate transactions from potential anomalies, thus safeguarding the financial system from fraudulent activities and ensuring customer trust.

## Dataset

The dataset we'll be working with is the Transaction Anomalies dataset. The dataset contains information about various financial transactions, each represented by several features

1. Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Transaction_Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
3. Transaction_Volume: The quantity or number of items/actions involved in the transaction.
4. Average_Transaction_Amount: The historical average transaction amount for the account.
5. Frequency_of_Transactions: How often transactions are typically performed by the account.
6. Time_Since_Last_Transaction: Time elapsed since the last transaction.
7. Day_of_Week: The day of the week when the transaction occurred.
8. Time_of_Day: The time of day when the transaction occurred.
9. Age: Age of the account holder.
10. Gender: Gender of the account holder.
11. Income: Income of the account holder.
12. Account_Type: Type of account (e.g., personal, business).

## Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Directory housing the Jupyter notebook (`Anomaly Detection in Transactions.ipynb`) where data loading, cleaning, exploration, and analyses take place.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, providing a project overview, dataset details, and project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Anomaly Detection in Transactions.ipynb`) to begin the exploratory data analysis.
